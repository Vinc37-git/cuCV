## Binaries in cuCV

A collection of `ccp` an `cu` files to build binaries.

Use `cucvconv.cpp` to build a program that can convolute images using a specified filter and filter size by passing cmd line arguments. Run `cucvconv --help` for help.

The other binaries can be run with `nvprof` or any other profiler to profile the cuCV functions.
