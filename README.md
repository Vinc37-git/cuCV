# cuCV - a CUDA accelerated Computer Vision Library


# Motivation

cuCV will be a lightweight Computer Vision Library written in CUDA and C++ and is inspired by openCV. It was born from a project idea after attending a class about efficient programming at the University of Stuttgart. Modern GPU acceleration has become a major part in computer vision and deep learning in recent years. However, to efficiently benefit from the increasing computational power as a researcher, knowledge of data preparation, GPU hardware, and algorithm adaptation is required. The best way to understand these characteristics is to do it yourself, which is why I decided to start learning CUDA hands-on doing this project.

The first programm version will feature an openCV-like Matrix Class with basic mathematical matrix operations and basic image processing functions like convolution and histogram operations.
