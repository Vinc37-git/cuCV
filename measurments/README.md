## Timing program

Build executables using `cucvRuntimeMeasurments.cpp` that will measure the runtime of various cuCV functions for differen matrix and filter sizes.

Note that the datatype can be defined using compile definitions. By default, 4 executables will be build for all available matrix datatypes in cuCV.
